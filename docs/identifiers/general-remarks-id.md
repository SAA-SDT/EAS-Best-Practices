# General remarks

**Schema:** 
EAC-CPF

**Context:** 
Identifiers used as unambiguous references in local systems are needed to identify or to refer to records, agencies, entities, resources, and authority files. There is a difference between identifiers for records and entities. 

**Description:** 
Different types of non-informational identifiers are used to identify 
* the present EAS instance within the element `<recordId>`, cf. [Record identifiers](record-id.md)

Or to refer to
* other records of the same resource or entity as described in the EAS instance within the element `<otherRecordId>`, cf. [Record identifiers](record-id.md)
* the agency, responsible for creation, maintenance or dissemination of the EAS instance within the element `<agencyCode>`, c.f. [Agency Codes](agency-codes.md)
* the entity, thus the person, family or corporate body, described the present EAC-CPF instance within the element `<identityId>`, c.f. [Entity Identifiers](entity-id.md)
* the materials being described in an EAD instance within the element `<unidid>`, c.f. ID of the Unit (coming soon)
