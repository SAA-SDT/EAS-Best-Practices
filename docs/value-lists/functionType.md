**Scope Note:**
To indicate whether the described entity is a function or one of its subdivisions, in accordance
with national or international terminology. Alternatively, one might speak about types of activities; while function is considered appropriate when describing corporate bodies, positions, and mechanisms, the term activity also applies to persons and families.
