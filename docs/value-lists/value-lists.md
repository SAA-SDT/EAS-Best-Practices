# EAS Value Lists

Value lists are provided as controlled terms defined by TS-EAS. EAC-CPF 2.0 has these value lists defined in the schema; EAD 4.0 asks for an indication within `<control>` as to whether the EAS lists are used or whether the values are taken from another list. When elements or attributes have constrained data values, i.e. in EAC-CPF 2.0 or when EAD 4.0 is used with "EASList" as the encoding source, choose the appropriate term as defined in the EAS tag libraries. Some examples can be found below.
